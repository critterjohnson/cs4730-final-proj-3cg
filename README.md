## Pitch

We’re creating a game that captures the mysticism and satisfying feeling of
bouncing screen logos by utilizing a bouncing ball to overcome obstacles and
solve puzzles. Each level works to integrate the ball’s bounciness (or lack
thereof), designing puzzles and enemies around the specific properties of the
ball (and subsequently gameplay). We’re creating the game around a single,
perfected mechanic, and we’re telling the whole thing from the perspective of
one of the lowliest creatures: the dung beetle.

## How to Play

To play, you only need A/D or the left/right arrow keys, spacebar, and the E
key. A/D move the player character left and right. E begins rolling the dung
ball. The dung ball grows in size (and weight) as the player moves on the
ground and holds E.

Use your dung balls to help Beetle Bub save Beetle Babe from Froggington!

## Lessons Learned

The major lesson we learned was about scope. We found that we had a lot of big
ideas, but not enough time to bring a lot of them to fruition. We discovered
that it was much better to take a very incremental approach.

Additionally, we found that agreeing on an order in which we accomplished tasks
was important. Certain tasks depend on others (like needing at least basic
character movement to start implementing other mechanics.
